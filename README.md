Sleep_Buster
============

An Android app that checks alertness of drivers and keeps them awake to avoid potential dangers of drowsy driving.

Studies have shown that the majority of drowsy driving accidents happen to solo drivers and that 82% of 
the time,  the driver had no-one with whom to converse. 

The app has a timer that plays audible questions to the driver. The driver responds by selecting a response to each question. 
If he/she fails to respond within 15 seconds, the app will record this as an error condition. 

When the error threshold is reached, the app will play a loud alarm sound to let the driver know he/she has reached the danger zone. 

Technologies used include:
- Android API 20 (Services and Activities)
- Android Text To Speech API 

Features:
App runs continuously until stopped by the User, making it suitable for longer trips
Use of open source tools and technologies, so the community can participate in improvments

For a sample User Story, please see the Wiki. 

Future iterations will include voice recognition for driver responses and integration with Google maps.
